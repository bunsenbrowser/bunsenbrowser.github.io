# ![bunsen logo](bunsen-logo.png) Bunsen Browser 

<div style="float: left; width: 70%;">
  
  An experimental P2P web browser for Android that uses [Dat](https://datproject.org) to download and share websites, online and offline.

  If you have an Android device with an ARMv7 processor you can try it out. It's a work-in-progress. [Download the beta3 APK](https://goo.gl/w3PYdd), install and launch, then visit one of the dat sites listed or find - or create - your own!
  
  To load another dat, enter a new address or select a dat from the history, which is listed below the input box when you are typing in it.

  Bunsen will open sites with links to dats (`a href=dat://`) too. In your device's browser, check out [hashbase.io](http://hashbase.io) for a list of sites and click the dat links to open them in Bunsen.

  Give it a try and let us know what you think!
