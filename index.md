# ![bunsen logo](bunsen-logo.png) Bunsen Browser 

<div style="float: left; width: 70%;">
  
  An experimental P2P web browser for Android that uses [Dat](https://datproject.org) to download and share websites, online and offline.

  [Download the beta2 APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GRlzMzjitL27tyahs2qfkm8QvZneWS_z/view?usp=sharing), to your Android device and then tap the download to install and launch.  Then try visiting your first Dat site at dat://exploder-creationix.github.io/.
  
  To load another dat, enter a new address or select a dat from the history, which is listed below the input box when you are typing in it.

  Bunsen will open sites with links to dats (`a href=dat://`) too. In your device's browser, check out [hashbase.io](http://hashbase.io) for a list of sites and click the dat links to open them in Bunsen.

  Give it a try and let us know what you think!
