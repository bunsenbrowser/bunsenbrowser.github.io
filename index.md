# ![bunsen logo](bunsen-logo.png) Bunsen Browser 

<div style="float: left; width: 70%;">
  An experimental P2P web browser for Android that uses [Dat](https://datproject.org) to download and share websites.

  If you have an Android device with an ARMv7 processor you can try it out. [Download the APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GRlzMzjitL27tyahs2qfkm8QvZneWS_z/view?usp=sharing), install and launch, then visit dat://blog-rjsteinert.github.io/. 
  
  To load another dat, enter a new address or select a dat from the history, which is listed below the input box when you are typing in it.

Bunsen will open sites with links to dats (`a href=dat://`) too. In your device's browser, check out [hashbase.io](http://hashbase.io) for a list of sites and click the dat links to open them in Bunsen.
